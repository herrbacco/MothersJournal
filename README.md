# MothersJournal
A journaling application that prompts for relevant topics for new mothers, helping to capture the full picture of parenthood.


## Goals
This project arises out of a need for keeping up-to-date on journaling in the context of new parent exhaustion that permeates their lives. Without special motivation to write about and document our new babe's life, falling behind is easy and common. And once fallen behind, the difficulty in getting back on track can be insurmountable.
This journal hopes to aid in the process of being successful parents and, at the same time, successfully documenting that parenting.

## Basic Operations
This will be a blog-like journal that accepts entries. Each entry will be tagged with any number of topical tags, eg. MOBILITY, VERBAL, DEXTERITY. The user will be prompted to reflect on certain topics based on lack of journal entries addressing them. The user will be able to adjust the frequency of topical prompts.
The user will also be able to view the development of tags based on the history of journal entries.

## Advanced Features
-Able to use document classification techniques to automatically tag journal entries with a topical tag.
-Based on the frequency of topical tagging done, adjust topical quota functions to match natural 'average' progression.

## Grand Ideas
Automatic, asks you questions on the fly, when you're known to have downtime/not doing anything anyway. Notices topical developmental steps as they happen, doesn't miss any of them, prompts user for a comment. Records everything. Categorizes everything. Makes qualitative judgements on photo/video/audio data. Makes a highlight reel, can be custom delivered any length, any sentiment, any developmental achievement.
